Please read this software license agreement (“License”) carefully 
before using the Software.  By using the Software, you are agreeing 
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License.  If you do 
not agree to the terms of this License, do not use the Software.  If 
Licensee is an entity, you acknowledge that you have the authority to 
accept the terms of this License on the entity’s behalf and shall 
make other users of the Software aware of the Licensee’s 
responsibilities under this License.  This License applies to any 
update, upgrade, supplement or support service provided by SMART for 
the Software, unless accompanied by a separate license, in which 
case, that license shall apply.
1. DEFINITIONS:

Licensee Applications to SMART for verification that the application 
meets the then current SMART established requirements to be deemed 
SMART accredited as set out in the SMART’s Software and Content 
Accreditation Program.  Licensee Applications that have successfully 
gone through the Accreditation process are deemed “Accredited”.  
The Accreditation process and requirements are available at the SMART 
Ecosystem Network (at sen.smarttech.com).  SMART may accept or reject 
such applications in its sole discretion.
1.1 “Commercial Use” means distribution, redistribution, resale 
or transfer, or any other form of use for any purpose other than 
Internal Use, and includes (without limitation) the following 
purposes: “Free Commercial Use”: licensing or providing for free 
download (provided it is truly for free and not as part of a bundled 
package or offered as an inducement to purchase another product), or 
for demonstration purposes (subject to the other terms of this 
License), or “For Fee Commercial Use”: providing, licensing or 
sale for a fee (including as part of any type of bundle) or offered 
as an inducement to purchase another product.
1.2 “Competitive Product” means any hardware or product bundled 
with hardware that is not a SMART Product and that is made 
commercially available with substantially similar or overlapping

other form of use within the Licensee organization only, which may 
include: a) designing, developing, prototyping, evaluating and 
testing the Licensee Application provided solely within the Licensee 
organization, even where the Licensee Application is intended for 
Commercial Use, or b) providing the Licensee Application to third 
parties under confidentiality and non-distribution agreement as a 
proof of concept or usability trials; however excludes distribution, 
redistribution or any other form of use, such as: download, licensing

executable derivative works created from the Demo Source Code or 
otherwise derived by combining the Software in unmodified compiled, 
executable code format with code developed by Licensee.  For clarity, 
the code entitled SBSDK.dll is a Redistributable, however, may only 
be redistributed in an unmodified form. The code entitled SBSDK.lib, 
SBSDK.h, and SBSDKComWrapper.dll (available through the SMART Product 
Drivers CD) are not Redistributables, however may be used for 
development purposes, subject to their respective licenses.

to production use), however, does include the right to permit any 
third party (including End Users) to access the Software to perform 
acceptance testing on the Licensee Application.
2. LICENSE GRANT:
2.1 General.  The Software is protected by copyright laws and 
international copyright treaties as well as other intellectual 
property laws and treaties.  The rights granted in this License are 
limited to SMART’s and its licensors’ intellectual property 
rights in the Software and do not include any other patents or 
intellectual property rights. The Software is licensed, not sold and 
is subject to the terms and restrictions of this License.  This 
License only grants the Licensee some rights to use the Software.  
The Licensee agrees that nothing in this License conveys to the 
Licensee any right, title or interest in the Software, including all 
intellectual property rights created by or arising out of the 
performance of this License, and the intangible concepts, knowledge, 
ideas, information, methodologies and know-how contained in and given 
effect through the Software.  All rights not expressly granted are 
reserved by SMART.  Unless applicable law grants Licensee more rights 
despite the limitations contained in this License, Licensee may only 
use the Software as expressly permitted in this License.  In the 
event the Software is delivered on a CD, DVD, USB or other form of 
physical media, Licensee owns such media on which the Software is 
recorded, but SMART and/or SMART’s licensor(s) retain ownership of 
the Software itself. 
2.2 Grant of License.  Subject to Licensee complying with these 
license terms, Licensee shall have the rights set forth as follows.  
SMART grants and Licensee accepts a non-exclusive, non-transferable, 
limited license to Use the Software subject to the following 
limitations:
(a) License Restrictions.  Licensee may Use the Software (i) on an 
reasonable number of computing devices owned and controlled by 
Licensee; and (ii) if Licensee has consultants using the Software on 
the Licensee’s behalf, on one computing device that may be 
personally owned by each such Licensee consultant, for so long as 
they continue to be Licensee’s consultant using the Software on the 
Licensee’s behalf; provided Licensee ensures all users of the 
Software on any such computing devices are made subject to and comply 
with the terms of this License.
(b) Copies.  Licensee may make one copy of the Software in 
machine-readable form for backup purposes only, provided that the 
backup copy must include all trademarks, copyright or other 
proprietary notices contained on the original media. Licensee may 
copy the Documentation for internal purposes only. Licensee may not 
publish or commercially distribute copies of the Software or any 
component thereof. 
(c) Technical Restrictions.  In exercising its rights under this 
License or otherwise at law, Licensee must comply with any technical 
restrictions in the Software that restrict the use of the Software to 
certain ways.  Licensee may not work around any technical 
restrictions in the Software.
(d) Modifications and Enhancements.  Other than the Demo Source Code 
as described in this subsection 2.2(d), Licensee may not modify, 
enhance, adapt, or vary the Software, or create derivative works 
based on the Software, or merge or separate the Software or any 
component thereof without SMART’s prior written consent.  The Demo 
Source Code is proprietary and confidential to SMART.  Licensee may 
modify and make derivative works of the Demo Source Code, and may 
otherwise combine, link statically (or, in the case of the SBSDK.dll 
only, dynamically) or otherwise associate the Redistributables with 
Licensee or other third party code to create part of the Licensee 
Application, subject in all cases to the use and redistribution 
rights and limitations set out in subsection 2.2(e) below.  Licensee 
agrees that it will not combined the Redistributables or any other 
component of the Licensee Application, if the result of such 
combination, linking or other association or subsequent use or 
distribution would require the Demo Source Code or any 
Redistributable, or any portion thereof, to be made available 
publicly under the terms of a different license agreement, such as an 
open source license agreement, which would have the effect of 
overriding any of the restrictions or requirements set out in this 
License. 
(e) Redistribution Right.  Licensee may use the Software solely to 
develop, and test the Licensee Application; and to use and distribute 
Licensee Applications provided however that the Licensee Application 
and all Redistributables will only be distributed or redistributed: 
(i) in a manner primarily intended for End User’s use (and not for 
further resale, transfer, redistribution, development or 
modification), (ii) in conjunction with, and as part of, a Licensee 
Application that adds primary and significant functionality to the 
Redistributables (and, if applicable, to the Demo Source Code), and 
(iii) subject to the other terms contained in this License.   In 
addition to the above limitations, such distribution or 
redistribution (x) shall be in object code format only; (y) is 
pursuant to a license agreement, with terms no less protective than 
contained in this License; and (z) does not use SMART’s name, logo, 
or trademarks to market or otherwise in association with any product 
derived from any component of the Software, subject to the provisions 
of subsection 2.2(j) below.   LICENSEE SHALL BE LIABLE TO SMART FOR 
ANY DAMAGES THAT ARISE, INCLUDING LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, FOR A 
BREACH OF THE MODIFICATION AND REDISTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS SET OUT IN 
SUBSECTIONS (d) AND (e).  LICENSEE FURTHER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, HOLD 
HARMLESS, AND DEFEND SMART FROM AND AGAINST ANY CLAIMS OR LAWSUITS, 
INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES, THAT ARISE OR RESULT FROM THE USE OR 
DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSEE APPLICATION.  The Redistributables are 
also subject to the export restrictions described in Section 7 below. 
 Licensee shall not, without SMART’s express written prior 
approval, redistribute the Redistributables in a Licensee Application 
that is in effect a development tool, allowing third parties to build 
onto the Licensee Application or build their own Licensee 
Application. 
(f) Prohibition Against Reverse Engineering.  Subject to the express 
licenses set out in subsection 2.2(d), Licensee may not reverse 
engineer, reverse compile, translate, decompile, disassemble, modify, 
create derivative works or otherwise attempt to derive source code 
from (or the underlying ideas, algorithms, structure or organization 
of) the Software or any component thereof, for any purpose, including 
for the purpose of discovering any aspect of the technology inherent 
therein.
(g) Transfer, Distribute, Commercialize.  Other than as stated in 
this Section 2.2, Licensee may not rent, lease, lend or sublicense, 
distribute or supply the Software or any component thereof (this 
prohibition extends to the product license key for Software 
activation), or any works derived from the Redistributables 
(including any Demo Source Code) to any other party.  Licensee agrees 
that it shall not post, distribute or otherwise make available (other 
than within its organization and subject to no further 
redistribution) the product license key, if any, provided to it in 
order to install and/or activate the Software.  Licensee may use the 
Licensee Applications, including the Redistributables, for Internal 
Use without Accreditation.  Licensee may make Commercial Use of the 
Licensee Application only if the following conditions are met:
i. Licensee must submit the Licensee Application to SMART to seek 
Accreditation; 
ii. Licensee may make the Licensee Application available through 
various distribution methods, however, must allow SMART, at its sole 
discretion, to make the Licensee Application available on one of its 
websites (such as the SMART Exchange™ website), on a SMART 
associated webstore, or through a SMART approved program, where 
applicable:
iii. Licensee shall determine if the Licensee Application will be 
made available for Free Commercial Use or For Fee Commercial Use. In 
the event Licensee intends to make For Fee Commercial Use of the 
Licensee Application through any distribution method, SMART shall be 
entitled, but not obligated, to require Licensee to also a) offer the 
Licensee Application through a SMART approved program, or b) list 
such Licensee Application on an associated webstore, in each case, 
subject to the terms of such program or webstore, including the 
applicable fee or revenue sharing provisions, and in either case, 
Licensee shall make the Licensee Application available on at least 
the same pricing (or lower pricing) than any of its other 
distribution methods (most-favored-nation pricing); 
iv. Licensee shall ensure that the Licensee Application does not 
disable any SMART provided hardware, drivers or software 
functionality or change defaults of any SMART hardware, drivers or 
software settings. Prior to submission by Licensee to SMART for 
Accreditation by SMART of the Licensee Application, Licensee must 
obtain written approval from SMART in the event the Licensee 
Application would result in a change in defaults or disable certain 
functionality of SMART hardware, drivers or software, which approval 
may be withheld in SMART’s sole discretion.  Licensee shall be 
solely responsible for, and shall take all precautionary measures to 
prevent, the Licensee Application disabling or causing SMART 
hardware, drivers or software to become non-operational; 
v. Licensee shall not make the Licensee Application available through 
a store (web or otherwise) if such store is hosted or primarily 
branded by a manufacturer or marketer of non-SMART interactive 
display devices (regardless of how such display devices are mounted: 
horizontal, vertical or otherwise); and
vi. the End Users and all other recipients of a copy of the Licensee 
Application are subject to license terms at least as restrictive as 
this License in their use of the Licensee Applications (including 
that it shall be subject to license terms consistent with the Third 
Party Component License Provisions set out below for any 
Redistributables).
Licensee Applications offered for Commercial Use through a SMART 
branded website, associated webstore or through a SMART approved 
program may be removed from such site, store or program at SMART’s 
discretion, including if the Licensee Application is not compatible 
with a current or the immediately preceding version of the SMART 
Product.
For clarity, in the event the Licensee Application is not Accredited, 
Licensee shall not make any use of the Licensee Application other 
than Internal Use.  
In the event Licensee wishes to make the Licensee Application 
available in a country not supported by the SMART websites or 
associated webstores, or in the event the Licensee Application is 
being developed by Licensee for a single third party (such as another 
publisher), Licensee may request an exemption from subsections 2.2(g) 
(ii) and (iii) above by making its request to SMART at 
ecosystem@smarttech.com. In the event the jurisdiction for which an 
exemption applies is subsequently supported by the SMART websites or 
associated webstores, the provisions set out in subsections 2.2(g) 
(ii) (iii) shall apply at such time.   
(h) Development for other Platforms.  Licensee may Use the Software, 
and any portion thereof, to develop applications or programs for 
platforms other than the SMART Board interactive white board, 
provided such applications and programs also operate with at least 
similar or better functionality on the SMART Board interactive white 
board or other SMART Product, and subject to all of the other license 
restrictions contained in this License that would apply to Licensee 
Applications, including the restrictions set out in subsection 
2.2(f).  
(i) Licensee Application Name.  Licensee must not name or brand its 
Licensee Application using the word “SMART” or any phonetic 
variation of that word, by itself or in any combination of words or 
as part of a word or expression.  Licensee may include the entire 
phrase “for use with the SMART Board® interactive white board” 
after its name or brand of its Licensee Application.  Other than as 
stated in this Subsection 2.2(i) or in Subsections 2.2(j) or (l), 
this License does not grant Licensee any right to use any SMART 
trade-marks, trade names or service marks.
(j) Marketing, Promotion and Demonstration.  Licensee must not make 
any public statement or communication, or advertise or promote in any 
medium whatsoever that the Licensee Application is approved, 
accredited or otherwise endorsed by SMART, unless such endorsement 
has been obtained from SMART through its Software and Content 
Accreditation Program.  Should Licensee wish to provide SMART prior 
notice of any public use or display of the Licensee’s Licensee 
Applications (including trade industry conferences), it may do so at 
ecosystem@smarttech.com.
(k) Applicable Laws.  Licensee must comply with all applicable laws 
regarding the use of the Software and any component thereof.  
Licensee further acknowledges that Licensee shall be solely 
responsible to ensure that the Licensee Application meets all

statement, as directed by SMART.  
(m) Access to Third Party Programs.  The Software may include and/or 
be accompanied by third party software programs and content 
including, without limitation, freeware, (“Third Party 
Components”) that may require a separate end-user license agreement 
from the third party.  If the Licensee is using a Windows operating 
system, portions of this software use Microsoft Visual C++ and MFC 
run-times for Visual Studio .NET, Copyright Microsoft Corporation.  
This and any other Third Party Components are made available subject 
to the terms of their respective licenses, which terms may be 
different from or additional to those contained in this License.  To 
the extent that such licenses are in conflict with any of the rights 
or obligations granted to the Licensee under this License, the terms 
of the Third Party Component license shall prevail.  Acceptance of 
this License also confirms Licensee’s acceptance of such Third 
Party Components license terms.  SMART does not endorse or promote 
any products or services provided by third parties providing the 
Third Party Components.  You acknowledge that it is your 
responsibility to read, accept and comply with the terms and 
conditions of all such Third Party Component license agreements.

the Licensee Application complies with the Accreditation requirements 
and the requirements set out in this License.  Licensee acknowledges 
that its submission to SMART of the Licensee Application shall be on 
a non-confidential basis and that SMART may be in the process of 
developing or may in the future develop products or services with 
similar or overlapping functionality.  Nothing in this License shall 
act to prohibit SMART from independently developing an application to 
work with the SMART Product or Licensee Application.  
(q) Additional Software.  Licensee acknowledges that it, and each End 
User of the Licensee Application, must independently obtain and

REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES) INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE, 
MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION OR SALE OF A LICENSEE APPLICATION, INCLUDING 
ANY CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT ANY LICENSEE APPLICATION INFRINGES ANY THIRD 
PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, PROVIDED SMART PROMPTLY NOTIFIES 
YOU OF THE CLAIM.  
14. GENERAL:
14.1 Confidentiality.  Licensee acknowledges that the Software 
embodies confidential information of SMART and/or its suppliers and 
licensors. To the extent Licensee has access to any such information, 
Licensee agrees to use such information only for the authorized Use 
of the SMART Product and development of Licensee’s Licensee 
Applications.  Other than as incorporated into Licensee Application 
in accordance with the terms of this License, Licensee further agrees 
not to disclose such confidential information to any other party and 
to protect such confidential information to the same degree it 
protects its own confidential information, but with no less than a 
reasonable degree of care.  Software licensed under this License 
shall also be considered confidential information and, except as 
specifically permitted herein, shall not be disclosed to any third 
party.
14.2 Injunctive Relief.  Licensee acknowledge that, in the event 
Licensee breaches any provision of this License, SMART will not have 
an adequate remedy in money or damages.  SMART shall therefore be 
entitled to obtain an injunction against such breach from any court 
of competent jurisdiction immediately upon request without posting 
bond.  SMART's right to obtain injunctive relief shall not limit its 
right to seek further remedies.
14.3 Assignment.  Licensee may not assign this License or any of 
Licensee’s rights hereunder (by operation of law or otherwise) 
without SMART's prior written consent which may be unreasonably 
withheld.  For the purposes of this section, an assignment or 
transfer shall include any change in majority ownership or control of 
Licensee, including merger or other transfer of voting securities.  
SMART may assign this License without Licensee consent. Subject to 
the foregoing, this License shall be binding upon and inure to the 
benefit of the parties to it and their respective legal 
representatives, successors and permitted assigns.
14.4 Amendment.  No modification of this License shall be binding 
unless it is in writing and is signed by an authorized representative 
of the party against whom enforcement of the modification is sought.
14.5 Language.  Any translation of this License is done for local 
requirements and in the event of a dispute between the English and 
any non-English versions, the English version of this License will 
govern.
14.6 Governing Law.  This License is governed by the laws of the 
Province of Alberta, Canada, and the federal laws of Canada 
applicable therein, without reference to the conflict of law or 
choice of law principles.  Also to the extent permitted by applicable 
law, the parties irrevocably agree that any litigation involving this 
License, the Software or the SMART Product shall be brought in the 
provincial courts in the Province of Alberta or the federal courts of 
Canada, as the case may be.  Licensee agree that Licensee shall not 
assert any claim that Licensee is not subject to the jurisdiction of 
such courts, that the venue is improper, that the forum is 
inconvenient or any similar objection, claim or argument. This 
License shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on 
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of 
which is expressly excluded. 
14.7 Entire License.  This License constitutes the entire 
understanding and License of the parties and supersedes any and all 
prior or contemporaneous representations, negotiations, tender 
documents, proposals, understandings and Licenses between the parties 
with respect of the subject matter of this License. If any provision 
of this License is held invalid, it shall be severed from this 
License and the remainder of this License shall continue in full 
force and effect.
14.8 Waiver.  The failure by a party to exercise any right hereunder 
shall not operate as a waiver of such party's right to exercise such 
right or any other right in the future.
14.9 Force Majeure.  Either party’s failure to perform it 
obligations hereunder shall not be deemed a breach of this License if 
such failure is due to fire, strike war, civil unrest, acts of 
terrorism, government regulations, acts of nature, or other causes 
beyond the reasonable control of the party claiming force majeure.  
14.10 Feedback.  Licensee agrees that, should Licensee provide SMART 
with any suggestions, comments or feedback (including modifications 
or suggested modifications to any component of the Software or SMART 
Product) regarding the Software or SMART Product, SMART shall treat 
it as non-confidential and be free to use it for any and all 
purposes, without any compensation, acknowledgment or other 
obligation of any kind to Licensee.

sending it to the above address, or such other address SMART shall 
most recently have notified Licensee (including through the SMART 
Ecosystem Network website), and shall be sent “Attention: Legal 
Department”.  Notice to the Licensee, including, without 
limitation, of upgrades or updates to the Software or this License,
