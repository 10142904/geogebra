To compile the production mode version of the mobile platform in
command line, please

1. download the required 3rd party libraries by running
   "ant -f kickstart.xml",
 
2. go to the ../web/ directory and read INSTALL.txt on preparing
   for GeoGebraWeb compilation,
   
3. run build script with option "-M".

You may also use Eclipse to compile the mobile platform, but
it may require more physical memory. The mobile version is
known to compile on a modern Linux with at least 4 GB of RAM.
