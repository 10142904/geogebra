To compile the production mode version of the touch platform in
command line, please

1. download the required 3rd party libraries by running
   "ant -f kickstart.xml",
 
2. go to the ../web/ directory and read INSTALL.txt on preparing
   for GeoGebraWeb compilation,
   
3. run build script with option "-T".

You may also use Eclipse to compile the touch platform, but
it may require more physical memory. The touch version is
known to compile on a modern Linux with at least 4 GB of RAM.
