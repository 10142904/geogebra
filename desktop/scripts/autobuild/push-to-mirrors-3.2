# Pushes version 3.2 files to be deployed towards all mirror servers.
# To use it, set up remote mirror servers described at http://www.geogebra.org/trac/wiki/MirrorServers,
# create an ssh login there, and create an private/public key-pair by using ssh-keygen.
# Copy the public part to the remote machine by adding it to .ssh/authorized_keys2.
# This will provide automatic file copying between the host running this script
# and the remote machine.
# Edit details for each mirror server in mirrors.conf.
# The remote server must ensure that http://$IP/webstart
# is the same directory as "ssh -p $PORT $RUSER@$IP; cd $DIR".
