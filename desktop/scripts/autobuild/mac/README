main.m is a modified version of AppBundler's native/main.m from
https://java.net/projects/appbundler/sources/svn/content/appbundler/native/main.m.

build.xml is used by the AppBundler ant task. However, geogebra-jogl2.jar
as classpath is hardcoded and cannot be changed without recompiling
AppBundler.

Recompilation may be done on Mac OS X 10.7 with a fully functional
development subsystem after exporting JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home).
Full source code can be obtained from https://svn.java.net/svn/appbundler~svn.

The macsign script runs the AppBundler task and also JarBundler to create
an older version as well without bundled Java.
