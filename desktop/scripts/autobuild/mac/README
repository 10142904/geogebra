main.m is a modified version of AppBundler's native/main.m from
https://java.net/projects/appbundler/sources/svn/content/appbundler/native/main.m.

build.xml is used by the AppBundler ant task which is a rewritten
version of the original AppBundler by Oracle. Recompilation may be done
on Mac OS X 10.7 with a fully functional development subsystem after
exporting JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home). Full source code can be
obtained from https://svn.java.net/svn/appbundler~svn.

AppBundlerTask.java has also been changed. See the changed documentation
in appbundler.html.

The macsign script runs the AppBundler task and also JarBundler to create
an older version as well without bundled Java. Make sure to use the
correct build.xml file for the various GeoGebra versions.
