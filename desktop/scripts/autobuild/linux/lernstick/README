Creating custom packages for Ronny Standtke's lernstick
-------------------------------------------------------

The following folders are extra packages for the lernstick
which substitute or extend the original .deb packages:

  * igi-settings-1.1
  * lernstick-usertemplate-wheezy-pu-1.9

To create an up-to-date version of them, cd to their folder and
use this command line:

  $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b

This will create the required .deb files in .. (i.e., in
the same directory with this README file).

Then please go to ../debian and run the ./igi script to
upload the .deb files to GeoGebra's official Debian repository.
(The script may not be ported from the 4.4 branch yet.)
