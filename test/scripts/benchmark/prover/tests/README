To create a proof test in a .ggb file, make sure that the .ggb file
contains one and only one Prove statement. You should put the file
into true/ or false/, depending on the correct output.

Then run ./runtests in the parent directory. The .csv output will be
given on stdout, and also an .html export will be created in html/.
