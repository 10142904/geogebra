# Default settings for GeoGebraWeb autobuild.
# Edit it and save as autobuild.conf as required.

# Where is your GWT SDK installed? If you use Eclipse and followed
# the SetUp page in the GeoGebra wiki, then you already have it somewhere, probably here:
# GWTDIR=~/eclipse/plugins/com.google.gwt.eclipse.sdkbundle_2.4.0.relr37v201110112027/gwt-2.4.0

# If you used "ant -f kickstart.xml geogebraweb-developer-commandline", then you
# have GWT SDK in a different directory:
GWTDIR=../gwt-2.4.0
