GeoGebra - Dynamic Mathematics for Everyone
http://www.geogebra.org/

This directory contains the "desktop" and the "web" versions of GeoGebra.
The "common" directory contains the common parts for the two interfaces.

For compiling, running and installing the "desktop" version, please read
http://www.geogebra.org/trac/wiki/SetUp.

To compile and run the "web" version, please read
http://www.geogebra.org/trac/wiki/Web#Compilation. Since the web version
is in a pre-alpha state, you may want to try out its prototype,
GeoGebraMobile. For more details on this, please read
